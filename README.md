# Simple Python Port Scanner

This is a basic Python-based port scanner that allows users to:
- Scan custom port ranges or predefined ranges (common ports or full range).
- Identify open ports on a given host or IP.
- Display service names for common ports (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SSH, etc).
- Save scan results to a text file.
- Handle user interruptions (Ctrl+C) gracefully.
- Show scan progress using a progress bar (via `tqdm`).
